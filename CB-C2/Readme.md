4. Insert the Cable Gland into the mount using the threads (see pic below)
5. Add the two threaded inserts to the Mount where the Board on the standoffs

8. Install the Mount to the threaded insert at the bottom of the Cable Gland Mount using a M3x16 SHCS, don't over tighten and be sure the check that the mount opens about 90 degrees (see pic below)
