RC2:

- reworked the locking screw solution on the Door by offering a modified cable door for CW2.
	- This should option up more room for cables
	- This should fix issues with the right side not closing all the way
	- improved look and integration with CW2 was achieved with this as well
- Optional Sealing Nut for the cable gland is included
	- This should help if you are less worried about the extra strain relief and more worried about Z height
	- This should fix issues with the strain relief hitting the Top left bolt on the Switchwire

RC1.1:
 - Added a bit more space for the fan (it was too tight lol)

RC1: 

Change log:
- Complete redraw
- Rotated the board in the door (this was needed to allow DuPont connectors to have clearance)
- Validated Cable clearance for Dupont connectors and heaters 
- Moved the fan for better airflow over the whole board
- improved printability 
- Pivot of hinge is improved for more clearance
- validated a full travel on the X without hitting the mount
- Back is now only 0.019mm deeper than the X extrusion
- Mount is now compatible with version 1.1 boards



Beta 2 - 7/16/22
- Shaved 2mm off the back
- Shaved lower left edge due to concerns with hiting bolts on a full movement of the x carage. 
- Simplified design by removing the spacer
- improved printability
