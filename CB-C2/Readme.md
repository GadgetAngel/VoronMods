This is a StealthBurner Mount along with BLToucch for an Ender 3 with an MGN12 on the X

This is a remix of RepresentativeBlink mount for the Afterburner on a Ender 3 with an MGN12 rail

Also changed from RepresentativeBlink design is the following

Added tie wrap holders to the top for cables

Removed nuts that hold the two sections together and replaced them with heated inserts (needed the space for proper mounting of bltouch)

Reworked the bltouch mount (side now uses heated inserts to hold bltouch mount, bltouch mount also uses heated inserts to the bltouch to the mount)

Notice: The Heated inserts for ClockWork 2 or on the rear of the mount

The side which used to use two extreamly small self taping screws would break off on my so I changed it out with M3 heated insers for easier mounting

Also added is inserted nuts on the BLTouch atachment itself as trying to hold nuts while installing screws on this thing was nearly imposible for my fat finger espesially in the tight spot that this thing gets mounted
