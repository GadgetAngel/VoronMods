This is a StealthBurner Mount along with BLToucch for an Ender 3 with an MGN12 on the X

This A remix of RepresentativeBlink mount for the Afterburner on a Ender 3 with an MGN12 rail, for StealthBurner

Also changed from RepresentativeBlink design is the following

Added tie wrap holders to the top for cables

Removed nuts that hold the two sections together and replaced them with heated inserts (needed the space for proper mounting of bltouch)

Reworked the bltouch mount (side now uses heated inserts to hold bltouch mount, bltouch mount also uses heated inserts to the bltouch to the mount)
